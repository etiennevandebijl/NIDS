This github contains the code of the article ``Detecting Variants of Application Layer DoS/DDoS Attacks using Machine Learning" by Van de Bijl et al. 2021. 

The workflow starts in the Zeek folder with the extraction of log files by Zeek. After extracting from the raw pcap files, other datasets can be created using the files in the other folder in Zeek.
